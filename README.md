<b>•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b>

To make sure the code that I write is functional and secure I believe it is important to incorporate testing into every stage of the SDLC. The earlier you catch errors or bugs, the easier and as we learned the term, cheaper to resolve. Ideally someone else would be doing the testing to make sure it is done objectively however, if as the creator I am also doing the testing it is important to be able to change one’s frame of mind. As a tester I need to set out with the intention of finding errors rather then proving the code functions correctly. There are tools available to help automate the testing process such as running JUnit test for functionality and Dependency check for security but one shouldn’t overlook the power of manual review. 

<b>•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</b>

The best way to figure out what the user needs is it sit down and talk to the client. Knowing what the functional and non-functional requirements are for the system, how sensitive the data is that the system transfers or stores, and how large of a database the customers system has all play key factors in figuring out what the user’s needs are. To incorporate those needs, correct security algorithms should be implemented to ensure the user feels protected. Incorporating testing into every cycle of the SDLC including deciphering the requirements and building a design plan allows for early detection if the project is going in the wrong direction and not meeting the user’s needs. 

<b>•	How do I approach designing software?</b>

To design software, I go over the user’s requirements or an interview transcript to decipher what they envision for the system. I ask follow up questions to clarify gray areas. For projects like the one for this course it was also important to pay attention to government regulations for financial institutions.  I enjoy creating use UML diagrams and use cases and to visualize my design before the coding process begins.
